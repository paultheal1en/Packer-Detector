       not necessary to spill/fill it on most instructions that read/write the flags.
       (prior to flag splitting, whenever any of the flags needed to be spilled/filled
       both the DF and all the above status flags were spilled/filled).
       NOTE - this flag splitting is not done if the pushf/popf sequence is being used
              rather than the sahf/lahf sequence (some early Intel64 processors do not
              support sahf/lahf instructions). Also the KnobRegFlagsSplit can be used
              to disable the flags splitting when the sahf/lahf sequence is being used
       Flags splitting is not done at the INS operand level - it is done when building
       the vreglist for register allocation. So tools see the architectural flags registers
       in INSs. See the functions MakeRegisterList and REG_InsertReadRegToVreglist to see
       how the split flags are inserted into the vreglist.
       See jit_flags_spillfill_ia32.cpp file comments to learn how they are spilled/filled

     * *** Segment registers (FS/GS) handling in Pin ***
     *
     * Background about segment virtualization support in Pin:
     * Segment virtualization was introduced in Pin in the past in order to support Pin on OS's which didn't contain old
     * (without segment usage) libc in a standard installation.
     * Application and Pin were using 2 different TLS's, however access to them was done through segment registers
     * (Also known as thread-self-pointer registers)
     * (actually through their matching segment descriptor which contain the segment base address).
     * Segment register (selector) can have one value at a time. Changing segment register value back and forth (from application
     * to Pin and the other way around) is very costly performance wise (involve system calls).
     * Also there may have been other limitations.
     * Therefore it was decided to emulate application instructions which use segments registers.
     * This is done by saving segment selector value and segment base address in the spill area (i.e REG_PIN_SEG_GS_VAL
     * and REG_SEG_GS_BASE ) for each thread and performing all segment related instruction (of the application) using their
     * values (by emulating instructions that set these registers and translate instructions that are accessing the memory using
     * fs or gs prefix - we call this virtualizing segment).
     * (This also help when passing effective address of memory operands to analysis routines)
     * In Linux 32 bit the segment base address changes every time we write to a segment register (every time we load GS/FS,
     * the hidden part is also loaded with the segment base address - it's kind of a cache for optimization, to save bus cycles)
     * In order to support this beside emulating these in instructions we also tracked GDT/LDT tables (We store these tables
     * inside Pin and update them every time needed).
     *
     * Today we have PinCRT which doesn't use segment registers, therefore we don't have to virtualize application segment usage
     * and just let application execute these instructions in their original form (without modifying them or without emulating
     * them).
     *
     * Linux
     * In Linux we no longer virtualize application handling of segments: application instructions which uses segments or
     * segments prefix now runs in their original form.
     * In Linux 64 bits we now only track segment base address virtual register by emulating the system call which changes the
     * segment base address (track application segment base address inside a virtual register in addition to updating the
     * application one).
     * In Linux 32 bits it's more complicated: It's hard to track the segment address without fully emulating all writes to
     * segment registers + tracking the GDT/LDT which is a lot of work.
     * Instead we're using  GsBaseAddress()/FsBaseAddress() where needed including in PrecomputeSegBaseAddressIfNeeded() which
     * is called from SetupArgumentEa() when needing to compute REG_SEG_FS_BASE/REG_SEG_GS_BASE value (holds the segment base
     * address)
     *
     * macOS
     * In macOS, PIN still use (at least) the system loader which uses the GS segment register, therefore segment virtualization
     * is still used.
     *
     * Windows
     * In Windows we compute segment base address at the beginning (assume it doens't change) and use its value when needed.
     * REG_PIN_SEG_GS_VAL and REG_PIN_SEG_FS_VAL are unused in this platform
     *
